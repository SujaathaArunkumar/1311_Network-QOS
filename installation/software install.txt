Manually installing features and plug-ins on a FAT file system (Windows only)

When features and plug-ins are manually installed on top of an Eclipse-based product install located on a FAT file system that has already been run at least once, the product must be explicitly restarted with -clean. That is,

eclipse.exe -clean
Connecting to untrusted sites using https

You cannot install or update software from a site using https whose certificate is not chained to a trusted root certificate in your local certificate store. This typically means the server is using a self-signed certificate, or a certificate authenticated by an unknown third party.

Extension location is lost if the install path changes

A previously configured extension location may be temporarily removed if the install is moved or mounted under a different path. This only happens when the link file that configures the extension location uses a relative path that points to a directory under the Eclipse install. On a second startup using the same install path, the extension location is added again (bug 95403). 

Feature patches can only be installed from Eclipse 3.4-based update sites

Feature patches can only be installed from update sites designed for Eclipse 3.4 or greater. Specifically, the update site must have the necessary metadata for Equinox p2 (a content.xml or content.jar file). This data can be generated by building an update site using Eclipse 3.4 or newer, or running the p2 metadata generator on an update site built using earlier versions of the Eclipse SDK. See the help topic Generating p2 metadata for more details on running the p2 metadata generator (bug 244483).
