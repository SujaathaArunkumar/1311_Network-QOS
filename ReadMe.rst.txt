6. About (Short Description / Summary): Cloud multimedia services provide an efficient, flexible, and scalable data processing method 
and offer a solution for the user demands of high quality and diversified multimedia. As intelligent mobile phones and wireless networks
become more and more popular, network services for users are no longer limit to the home. Multimedia information can be obtained easily 
using mobile, allowing users to enjoy ubiquitous network services devices. Considering the limited bandwidth available for mobile streaming and different device requirements, this study presented a network and device-aware Quality of Service (QoS) approach that provides multimedia data suitable for a terminal unit environment via interactive mobile streaming services, further considering the overall network environment and adjusting the interactive transmission frequency and the dynamic multimedia transcoding, to avoid the waste of bandwidth and terminal power. Finally, this study realized a prototype of this architecture to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. According to the experiment, this method could provide efficient self-adaptive multimedia streaming services for varying bandwidth environments.
7. Install (Installation procedure): 
Execution Environment by Bundle

In the table below, the "4.1 minimum execution environment" column indicates the minimum Java class library requirements of each bundle for the 4.1 release, where the value is one of:

Entry	Meaning
F1.0 J2ME Foundation 1.0 - indicates that the bundle can only be run on Foundation 1.0 or greater. Note that with the exception of some MicroEdition IO classes, Foundation 1.0 is a subset of J2SE 1.3.
F1.1 J2ME Foundation 1.1 - indicates that the bundle can only be run on Foundation 1.1 or greater. Note that with the exception of some MicroEdition IO classes, Foundation 1.1 is a subset of J2SE 1.4.
1.3 J2SE 1.3 - indicates that the bundle can only be run on JSE 1.3 or greater.
1.4 J2SE 1.4 - indicates that the bundle can only be run on JSE 1.4 or greater.
1.5 Java SE 5 - indicates that the bundle can only be run on Java SE 5 or greater.
1.6 Java SE 6 - indicates that the bundle can only be run on Java SE 6 or greater.
